This project analyzes CitiBike usage patterns in New York City to help optimize operations, expand accessibility, and enhance user experience. Using the NYC CitiBike 2014 dataset, we conducted an exploratory data analysis to uncover insights into user behavior based on demographics, trip duration, seasonality, and station popularity.

Key findings reveal that CitiBike usage peaks from April to October, with high demand at popular stations requiring more bikes. Expansion beyond Midtown and Downtown into Upper Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens can improve accessibility. Additionally, subscriber-based models provide more stable revenue, and tailored pricing strategies can encourage casual riders to convert.

Our recommendations include optimizing station placement, adjusting bike availability based on demand, improving maintenance tracking, and enhancing engagement with female riders and commuters. These insights can help CitiBike refine its strategy and expand to untapped markets, ultimately improving urban mobility and sustainability.
